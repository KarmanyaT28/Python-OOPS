# Python __init__() method

# The __init__() Method

# all classes have a built in method called __init__(), which is always executed when teh class is
# being initiated

# The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties, or to perform operations that
# are necessary when the object is being created


# Create a class named Person, use the __init__() method to assign values for name and age:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age



p1 = Person("John", 22)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
