# Duck Typing in Python
# Duck Typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is less important 
# than the methods it defines. 
# Using this concept, you can call any method on an object 
# without checking its type, as long as the method exists.

# This term is defined by a very famous quote that states: 
# Suppose there is a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, 
# looks like a duck, and quaks like a duck then it probably is a duck.

# Example
# In the code given below, we are practically demonstrating the concept of duck typing.

class Duck:
    def sound(self):
        return "Quack, Quack!"
    

class AnotherBird:
    def sound(self):
        return "I am similar to Duck!"
    

def makeSound(duck):
    print(duck.sound())


# creating instances

duck = Duck()


anotherBird = AnotherBird()


# calling methods

makeSound(duck)
makeSound(anotherBird)

# # Method Overriding in Python


# In method overriding, a method defined inside a subclass has the same name 
# as a method in its superclass 
# but implements a different functionality.

# Example
# As an example of polymorphism given below, we have shape 
# which is an abstract class. It is used as parent by two classes circle and rectangle. 
# Both classes override parent's draw() method in different ways.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class shape(ABC):
   @abstractmethod
   def draw(self):
      "Abstract method"
      return

class circle(shape):
   def draw(self):
      super().draw()
      print ("Draw a circle")
      return

class rectangle(shape):
   def draw(self):
      super().draw()
      print ("Draw a rectangle")
      return

shapes = [circle(), rectangle()]
for shp in shapes:
   shp.draw()

# Overloading Operators in Python
# Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors, 
# what happens when you use the plus operator to add them? 
# Most likely Python will yell at you.

# You could, however, define the __add__ method in your class to perform 
# vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation âˆ’




class Vector:
    def __init__(self,a,b):
        self.a=a
        self.b=b

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Vector (%d, %d)' % (self.a, self.b)
    def __add__(self,other):
        return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)
    
v1 = Vector(2,10)
v2 = Vector(5,-2)
print (v1 + v2)

# Method Overloading in Python
# When a class contains two or more methods with the same name but different number of parameters then this scenario can be termed as method overloading.

# Python does not allow overloading of methods by default, however, we can use the techniques like variable-length argument lists, multiple dispatch and default parameters to achieve this.

# Example
# In the following example, we are using the variable-length argument lists to achieve method overloading.


def add(*nums):
    return sum(nums)

# Call the function with different number of parameters
result1 = add(10, 25)
result2 = add(10, 25, 35)

print(result1)  
print(result2)
