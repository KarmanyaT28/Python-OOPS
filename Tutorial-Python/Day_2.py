# You can build amazing programs using Python. Python is used widely in industry
# It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
# It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
# It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
# It supports automatic garbage collection. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
# In Data Science, Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used for data analysis and visualization.
# Python frameworks like Django, and Pyramid, make the development and deployment of Web Applications easy.
# This programming language also extends its applications to computer vision and image processing.
# It is also favored in many tasks like Automation, Job Scheduling, GUI development, etc. Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax.
# This allows the student to pick up the language quickly. Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes. Easy-to-maintain − Python('s source code is fairly easy-to-maintain. '
# A broad standard library − Python(')s bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh. '
# Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode that allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code. Portable −
# Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms. Extendable −
# You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient. '
# Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
# GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries, and Windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
# Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.)
